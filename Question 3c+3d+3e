//Question 3c:
Lyft's platform fee is the difference between what the rider pays ($20) and what the driver receives ($15).

So, the platform fee is:

Lyft Platform Fee = $20−$15 = $5



//Question 3d:
Stripe’s standard processing fees for a charge made on a platform like Lyft using Stripe Connect is typically:

-2.9% of the transaction amount
-Plus $0.30 per transaction

For the $20 ride payment:

Stripe Processing Fee=(2.9%×$20)+$0.30 = $0.88



//Question 3e
Lyft's earnings for this ride can be calculated by subtracting the Stripe processing fee from Lyft's platform fee.

Lyft Earnings = $5-$0.88 = $4.12
