// Transfer Reversal method

Since the payout has already occurred for the driver, we are using the transfer reveral method to pull $2 from that payout effectively only paying the driver $13.
The test bank account is not verified and we do not have a payment method on file so rather than making a charge, I decided to deduct this from his payout on the most recent ride.
This is useful especially if this is the last driver ever for the driver so we ensure payment is collected for the sign.
